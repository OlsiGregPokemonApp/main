// Psuedo Code

// Main Goals of App
  
  // Drop down menu with 20 pokemon(their pokedex number and name)
  
  // When selecting pokemon from drop down, their name, photo and type display below drop down menu
  
  // Changing selection of drop down changes the image, name and type to reflect what new pokemon is selected

  // If there is a amount of loading, display a "pokeball" where image is

  // namespace to organize our app - appPokemon = {};

  // store variables 
    // apiURL
  
  // create a method for URLSearchParams
    // name of selected pokemon
    // type of selected pokemon
    // sprite of selected pokemon
    
  // create a method to update variable of user selection of dropdown 
    
  // create init method to start app
  
  // STRETCHGOALS:
    // have two buttons besides selected pokemon card that will either move back one selection or forward one selection
      // this will update selected pokemon card as well as update selection in dropdown to reflect the new pokemon
    // If app takes time to load (could implement a load time), the a pokeball appears (maybe spins? - css implementation)
